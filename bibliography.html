Fieldwork bibliography. This is a mirror of the [Zotero database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4549903/lingfieldwork/library) for linguistic fieldwork. Note that it doesn't automatically refresh, so this page may be somewhat behind the zotero library.

I am not aiming to be comprehensive in this library. Rather, I'm aiming to provide a general overview of key topics.
