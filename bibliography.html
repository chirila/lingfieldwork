Fieldwork bibliography. This is a mirror of the [Zotero database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4549903/lingfieldwork/library) for linguistic fieldwork. Note that it doesn't automatically refresh, so this page may be somewhat behind the zotero library.

I am not aiming to be comprehensive in this library. Rather, I'm aiming to provide a general overview of key topics. You can sort by author, year, or tag (partially implemented). The Zotero library is organized by folder and might be more useful for additional class readings.
