# Software


I'm recommending the following software tools on the basis of what I've tried out. I welcome suggestions for new software tools - please send them to me using the ['issues' link](https://github.com/chirila/lingfieldwork/issues). This is not a comprehensive list.

* Data collection, lexical collection, interlinearisation, etc. I do not currently have a softwarse tool I can recommend. [Flex](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/download/) is popular but to my mind is deeply problematic. Briefly, the issues are that it only works on Windows; it is difficult to get information into and out of it. 
* Parsers: Alchemist (Review), Linguistica, ITE
* Lexicography: TshwaneLex (specifically for dictionary creation) (Review), LexiquePro; Toolbox
* Phonetics: Praat, Akustyk
* Corpus software (in addition to Toolbox): Monoconc
Sound editing: Audiamus, Audacity
Transcribing: Elan, Transcriber
Keyboard mapping software: Keyman
Fonts: IPA (Gentium, Charis, Doulos)

 There are also online tools, such as [Arbil](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2021826_7/component/file_2056578/content) and [lameta](https://www.lameta.org/home), which are a better choice for a full project.
