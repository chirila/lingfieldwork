# Software


I'm recommending the following software tools on the basis of what I've tried out. I welcome suggestions for new software tools - please send them to me using the ['issues' link](https://github.com/chirila/lingfieldwork/issues). This is not a comprehensive list.

* Data collection, lexical collection, interlinearisation, etc. I do not currently have a softwarse tool I can recommend. [Flex](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/download/) is popular but also problematic. Many currently work in [Elan](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) exclusively, which works ok if the primary mode of corpus compilation is video or audio, but does not work so well if there are also print materials
* Lexicography: 
    - [TshwaneLex](http://tshwanedje.com/tshwanelex/) (specifically for dictionary creation) (Review) 
    - LexiquePro and Toolbox are no longer maintained. 
* Phonetics: 
    - Praat
* Corpus software (in addition to Toolbox): 
    - Monoconc
* Sound editing: 
    - Audiamus
    - Audacity 
* Transcribing: 
    - Elan
    - Transcriber
    - Childes (CLAN?)
* Keyboard mapping software: 
    - Mostly not needed, 
    - Keyman
Fonts: IPA (Gentium, Charis, Doulos)

 There are also online tools, such as [Arbil](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2021826_7/component/file_2056578/content) and [lameta](https://www.lameta.org/home), which are a better choice for a full project.
