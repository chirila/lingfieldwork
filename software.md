# Software


I'm recommending the following software tools on the basis of what I've tried out. I welcome suggestions for new software tools - please send them to me using the ['issues' link](https://github.com/chirila/lingfieldwork/issues). This is not a comprehensive list.

* Data collection, lexical collection, interlinearisation, etc. I do not currently have a softwarse tool I can recommend. [Flex](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/download/) is popular but also problematic. Many currently work in [Elan](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) exclusively, which works ok if the primary mode of corpus compilation is video or audio, but does not work so well if there are also print materials
* Lexicography: 
    - [TshwaneLex](http://tshwanedje.com/tshwanelex/) (specifically for dictionary creation) (Review) 
    - [LexiquePro](http://lexiquepro.com/) and [Toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) are no longer maintained. They are listed here as lightweight programs that are useful for dictionary and field note curation, but it's unclear how long they will work. THey parse text files which can be backed up separately and read with other programs.
* Phonetics: 
    - [Praat](https://www.praat.org)
* Corpus software 
    - These days most people either use flex, Elan's flexible searches, or keep transcripts in a text file that they search using a GREP-enabled text editor.
* Sound editing: 
    - Audacity 
    - Audiamus
    - Praat
* Video editing:
    - xx
* Transcribing: 
    - Elan
    - Transcriber
    - Childes (CLAN?)
* Keyboard mapping software: 
    - Mostly not needed, since operating systems now mostly have this built in.
    - Keyman (if needed)
* Fonts:
    - Mostly not needed, since Unicode covers IPA and other 
    - IPA (Gentium, Charis, Doulos)
* Other software links:
    - UCL Speech prompt and record system software
    - Geoff Morrison's Acoustic Recording Software page
    - Praat scripts archive



 There are also online tools, such as [Arbil](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2021826_7/component/file_2056578/content) and [lameta](https://www.lameta.org/home), which are a better choice for a full project.
