# Checklists

The book contains several checklists for the field. There are included here in PDF format. You may download and print them for your own personal use but you may not further distribute them without written permission. Please provide a link to this page instead. Not all the checklists from the book are included here; this is only a sample (plus some other material which did not appear in the book).

* Equipment [PDF](files/EquipmentSetup.pdf)
* Elicitation procedure and data gathering checklist [PDF](files/ElicitationChecklist.pdf)
* Questions to consider when writing fieldnotes [PDF](files/Fieldnotes.pdf) (created for Rice field methods class, 2005/6)
* Sample consent form, including sample oral consent script [PDF](files/Consent.pdf) [docx](files/Consent.docx)

Note: Many IRBs have their own requirements for the content of consent forms, and there may be legal requirements for wording in some cases. Check with your IRB.
