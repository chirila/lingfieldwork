# Additional topics

These are additional topics that aren't in the published book and should be (hopefully for the next edition). At the moment, they are musings rather than points to be tied to particular parts of the book.


## On the 'field' and positionality (including my positionality)

One thing that I'd assumed in the first and second editions but should have made clearer is that the "field", and a researcher's relationship to it, look very different from individual to individual. When I do fieldwork, I typically work with communities in the country I grew up in, but I'm not of the same ethnicity. Others work on their own languages, with members of their own communities. Others work in a different country. Where I work, we have a common language (with different dialects) but I'm not a native speaker of the languages I do linguistic work on (though I try to learn them fluently); others do fieldwork on a language they grew up with, as an active speaker or as a rememberer. Others work through a second or third language. 

Another thing that I should have been more nuanced about is the goals of fieldwork. It's sort of there at various points in the book and perhaps my own thinking on this has changed over the years, but it's very important to be honest about the goals and motives of fieldwork and who *precisely* is served by the work you are planning to do. For example, I do fieldwork with both academic and community goals in mind -- sometimes they overlap, and sometimes they don't. It's important to me that my work is useful to the people I work with, but figuring out things about language (in general, and in particular about language change) is also important to me. Sometimes those goals overlap closely; sometimes one is prioritized, sometimes the other; some of the people I work with share both those goals, but most have either one or the other. 

I wrote this book to have a textbook for the field methods class I was teaching at Rice (and subsequently at Yale) because I felt the existing works at the time were badly out of date and did not sit well with what I wanted my students to learn. In particular, the books available at the time were very centered on linguistic questions, or described a relationship between communities and linguists that was both foreign to my experience and very different from what I wanted my students to take away. 

## On modality and signed languages

Both the first and second editions of this book are very strongly oriented towards spoken languages, and have minimal discussion of signed languages. The third edition will change that. I've added some notes in the [chapter-by-chapter notes](chapters.md) about additional references and comments for signed languages, so this book is more useful to fieldwork with all languages, not just one specific modality.
