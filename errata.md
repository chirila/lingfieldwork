# Errata for First Edition

(These errata refer to page numbers for the first edition; they were, I believe, all corrected for the 2nd edition).

* p49: In the comment about class preparation: I meant the preparation for the teacher/instructor, not for the student doing homework. That might not be clear.
* p60: The first 'rem.pst' gloss should read 'rec.pst' (recent past)
* p78: Insert full stop before 'Ethical reasoning' in table.
* p83: The capital engma (ŋ) was mysteriously converted to a lowercase one by the typesetter in the last round of corrections. Words  beginning with ŋ which begin a sentence should have Ŋ, not ŋ.
* p85: miannyan in the Bardi is a typo: it should be minnyan. Also, inarli-jjirri is hyphenated in the middle of a morpheme; a more rational hyphenation would have been inarlij-jirri.
* p88: Section 6.4.3: you can do this using Praat.
* p92: Section 6.5.2: a new edition of Shopen's Language Typology and Syntactic Description is out (click [here](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Typology-Syntactic-Description-Second/dp/0521675286/) for the complete set of volumes in the new edition)
* p93: The table should be single-spaced.
* p100: _nhalil_ in them?' (add question mark)
* p113: balgurr should be balgurr.
* p118: ... than one > from one ...
* p120: 40,000 words is very useful
* p157: If It's worth...
* p168: "and child abductions" change to "and Government child abduction"
* p168: So I thought ...
* p168: and when she hid in a boat ... change to "or when she hid in a boat"
* p180: Respect other's attempts .. change to "respect others' attempts"
* p182: Find out the procedure for appeals if you feel that the rejection was on unreasonable grounds.
* p247: add language contact, 139 to the index.
* passim: I've occasionally said 'tape recorder' in the text, however the advice refers to any recording device.
