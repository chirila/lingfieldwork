## Summary of available recording devices

This material was originally going to be part of the book but was removed to save spave and because it dates quickly. I'm leaving it up as a reminder of just how quickly this has dated. Only two of these types of recorder are regularly used now. The others are left for interest.

* Compact Flash recorders [PDF](docs/files/solidstate.pdf)
* Recording directly to computer [PDF](docs/files/comprec.pdf)


Legacy: 

* (Analogue) Cassette [PDF](docs/files/Analogue.pdf)
* MP3/MP4 and Ipods [PDF](docs/files/mp3.pdf)
* DAT [PDF](docs/files/DAT.pdf)
* Minidisc [PDF](docs/files/Minidisc.pdf)
* CD recorder [PDF](docs/files/CD.pdf)
